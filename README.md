### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Angel

---

I'm currently finishing up my senior year at Columbia Universityâ€”and will start working as a SWE at Google after graduation, in the Ads product area.

Despite being a steadfast old school Rails enthusiast, I'm excited for the new development frameworks, languages, and tooling that come out everyday and hope to contribute in any way I can.
